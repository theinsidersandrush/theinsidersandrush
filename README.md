### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

**theinsidersandrush/theinsidersandrush** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my own Minecraft mod and HTML webpage for fun
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript (love and hate), Java and C++.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on someone that has more experiences.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with someone.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: Why do trees talk?
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: On Twitter (don't call it "X". I don't like it.), Bluesky (@theinsidersandrush.bsky.social) and [Mastodon](https://pawoo.net/@theinsidersandrush)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him, Straight
- âš¡ Fact:
  - 1. also dope on the mic
  - 2. [Touhou Malaysia](https://twitter.com/TouhouMalaysia) is my kind of account personality that post shitpost Touhou in my [native language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Malay) and English. I created that account because of my annoyances with [TouhouSpain](https://twitter.com/TouhouSpain) showing up practically everywhere.
