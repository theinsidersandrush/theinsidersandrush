### Hi there 👋

**theinsidersandrush/theinsidersandrush** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my own Minecraft mod and HTML webpage for fun
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JavaScript (love and hate), Java and C++.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on someone that has more experiences.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with someone.
- 💬 Ask me about: Why do trees talk?
- 📫 How to reach me: On Twitter (don't call it "X". I don't like it.), Bluesky (@theinsidersandrush.bsky.social) and [Mastodon](https://pawoo.net/@theinsidersandrush)
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him, Straight
- ⚡ Fact:
  - also dope on the mic
  - [Touhou Malaysia](https://twitter.com/TouhouMalaysia) is my kind of account personality that post shitpost Touhou in my [native language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaysian_Malay) and English. I created that account because of my annoyances with [TouhouSpain](https://twitter.com/TouhouSpain) showing up practically everywhere. (+ verification / 'blue tick' makes me complete insane when I saw one.)
